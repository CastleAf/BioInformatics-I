# The Skew Diagram

Finding the minimum of the skew value (G nucleotides - C nucleotides) on a genome should help on locating the ori. As seen by the diagram below (from the course's page on Stepik):

We can observe that the values where skew is minimum and starts increasing should point out the position of the origin of replication.
