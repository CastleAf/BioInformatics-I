# BioInformatics-I

This repository stores all the programs I've written while attending Coursera's online course: [Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis?specialization=bioinformatics). This course focuses on teaching Bioinformatics for both learners with biology or computer science backgrounds. The Honors path (the path I followed) uses an external tool - [Stepik](https://stepik.org/). This path adds a more in depth explanation of the algorithms and involves a series of exercises to solve by coding.

While solving these problems, I focused on keeping the code clean and efficient, maintaining documentation where needed and aiming for low complexities - both in time and space.
